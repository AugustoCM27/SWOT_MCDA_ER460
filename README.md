# SWOT_MCDA_ER460
The project proposes the application of multi-criteria methods for ordering the
alternatives listed for the formation of the SWOT matrix, used in one of the phases of Unicamp's
Strategic Planning. In each of the quadrants, for each decision maker, a method based on the use
of the PROMETHEE-II ordering strategy was developed to define preferences. In a second
analysis, based on the individual rankings, an ordering for the group is suggested, using the
Borda and Condorcet methods.
